At times if you shine too much it becomes a problem..
There's a lot of individuals on planet earth who don't actually know day time and when to be seen or heard..Prison teaches that well and top security institutions but like everything else poorly managed empires crumble that's why I hardly sleep because I know about creeps and in times of grief I don't fold coz I've done way more than many without an accountant or a secretary my security is who I give thanks to the rest meaning the latter may have just run out of luck ..
